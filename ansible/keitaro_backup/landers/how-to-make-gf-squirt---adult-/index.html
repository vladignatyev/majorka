So listen up young man…<span id="more-5168"></span><p></p>
<p>Because I’m about to teach you something that very few men know how to do correctly (to be honest I wasn’t doing it right either until <strong>my buddy</strong></span></span> showed me).</p>
<p>I’m going to show you exactly <strong>how to make women squirt</strong>… using only one hand… some lube and an open minded frisky woman.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If the girl doesn’t trust you or you haven’t built enough comfort… she WILL NOT orgasm, let alone squirt. So you need to make sure she’s really into you before attempting this stuff.</p>
<p>You’re going to learn what squirting orgasms are, the different types of orgasms women can have and most importantly how to make a woman squirt her love juice all over the bed.</p>
<p>Ready? This is going to get messy…<br/>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span id="Different_types_of_orgasms_a_woman_can_have"><strong>Different types of orgasms a woman can have</strong></span></h2>
<p>Men can only have one type of orgasm (sucks I know) but women can actually have two…</p>
<h3><span id="Clitoral_orgasm"><strong>Clitoral orgasm</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most common among women, direct stimulation of the clitoris and happens during masturbation. You can also give them a clitoral orgasm orally, if you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Quick tip: Did you know that women have as many nerve endings in their clitorus as men do in their penis? Crazy right? Now you get why it’s SO sensitive for women foreplay and sex.</p>
<p>Also most women only really experience one clitoral orgasm, because the clit can become VERY sensitive and sometimes even sore.</p>
<h3><span id="Vaginal_orgasm"><strong>Vaginal orgasm</strong></span></h3>
<p>Comes from the inside of the vagina from either the G-spot or the deep spot. This is the kind of female orgasm that can infuse their entire body, making them feel numb and shiver with excitement uncontrollably.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to have multiple vaginal orgasms, so you can (if done right) make her cum more than once… heck more than 3 or more times during sex, which will give her an overwhelming sensation… like a constant wave of pleasure all over her body.</p>
<p>Quick note: Did you know that only 20% of women have experienced a vagnial orgasm? That means over 80% of women haven’t experienced one and most likely don’t even know what the hell it is… madness!</p>
<p>…And a staggering 29% of women have NEVER had an orgasm!

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span id="How_to_make_women_squirt8230_foreplay_techniques_for_the_G-spot"><strong>How to make women squirt… foreplay techniques for the G-spot</strong></span></h2>
<p>This is the good stuff, grab a coffee and take note big man:</p>
<h3><span id="Lube_up_first"><strong>Lube up first</strong></span></h3>
<p>To intensify the pleasure, you should use a water based lube when using finger based foreplay which is what you will be doing here to make her squirt.</p>
<p>A great natural lubricant is grape seed oil, which is also awesome for massaging as well as G-spot stimulation with the fingers.</p>
<h3><span id="Get_your_hands_ready"><strong>Get your hands ready</strong></span></h3>
<p>Remember that the vagina is a very sensitive area for a woman, so you must look after your hands… cut your nails, moisturise and keep them clean so they are soft and smooth.</p>
<p>I’d even recommend getting a manicure.. yes I know it’s not manly, but it will make sure your hands are ready for her.</p>
<h3><span id="Locate_the_G-spot"><strong>Locate the G-spot</strong></span></h3>
<p>The big “G” is a part of the urethral sponge and is located between 1 and 2 inches (2 knuckles) inside the vagina, along the front wall, which is the top if the girl was laying on her back basically.</p>
<p>As a woman becomes a lot more aroused, you should feel the G-spot swell up and become more pronounced, this is a GOOD sign that she’s ready to be penetrated… but we want to save that for later as the aim here is to make her squirt.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.pornhub.com/embed/1461524183" width="100%" height="400px"></iframe>
<h3><span id="Technique_1_Stroking"><strong>Technique 1: Stroking</strong></span></h3>
<div id="attachment_5189" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-5189" src="https://d1dig880uw3e6o.cloudfront.net/howtomakegfsquirt/stroking-technique.gif" alt="Get warmed up with this technique." width="600" height="400"><p class="wp-caption-text">Get warmed up with this technique.</p></div>
<p>Ok so the first the first technique is called “stroking”. To do this, take your index finger or middle finger… place it inside the vagina and go up, so you are touching the front wall.</p>
<p>Now with your finger inside and touching the G-spot, begin stroking backwards and forwards, with a “come here” motion as if you’re stroking it. Don’t be too gentle, you need to be firm.</p>
<p>Start with shorter slower strokes when you first enter, but build up momentum and speed up after a few minutes. Once she’s really getting into it, try two fingers (your index and middle fingers) and use the same stroking motion.</p>
<p>Never use 2 fingers right away, always begin with 1.</p>
<h3><span id="Technique_2_Overdrive"><strong>Technique 2: Overdrive</strong></span></h3>
<div id="attachment_5190" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-5190" src="https://d1dig880uw3e6o.cloudfront.net/howtomakegfsquirt/overdrive-technique.gif" alt="Kick it into overdrive and make her go crazy!" width="600" height="400"><p class="wp-caption-text">Kick it into overdrive and make her go crazy!</p></div>
<p>Right then… this is where the magic happens. Now that you’ve been stimulating the G-spot and stroking it for 10 to 15 minutes. You should feel it ballooning inside and she should be groaning with pleasure.</p>
<p>This is the point where you want to take things into “overdrive”. For this you will need to be right beside her (like on your knees if you’re on the bed” and use both your middle finger and ring finger to penetrate the same spot.</p>
<p>Now with your fingers inside, you need to rest the palm of your hand on the clitorous, almost cupping it. Once you’re in position, begin slowly stroking, whilst speeding up and then start to pull your hand up and down so you stimulate the clit at the same time.</p>
<p>Speed up some more and be a lot firmer as you’re speeding up…</p>
<p>…Speed up EVEN more…. now some more…. and finally go as fast as you can until she climaxes (squirts) all over the bed.</p>
<p>Now not all women will squirt, but a lot will. I’ve only had one girl who couldn’t squirt and I did everything correctly. You should feel the vaginal wall tighten and put pressure on your fingers, this means you’ve done the job well.</p>
<p>Boom! You’re all done!</p>
<p>By now your hands… the bed and her vagina should be covered in her love juice. Don’t worry it’s not pee, like some guys think. It’s ejaculate fluid which comes out of the urethra, not the vagina.</p>
<p>The female ejaculation fluid comes from the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene's_gland">skene’s gland</a>&nbsp;and has a sweet taste to it (due to the glucose contents).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span id="How_to_make_a_girl_squirt_checklist"><strong>How to make a girl squirt checklist</strong></span></h2>
<div id="attachment_7637" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-7637" title="How To Make A Girl Squirt - Checklist" src="https://d1dig880uw3e6o.cloudfront.net/howtomakegfsquirt/how-to-make-a-girl-squirt-checklist.png" alt="How To Make A Girl Squirt - Checklist" width="350" height="300"><p class="wp-caption-text">Make sure you do this every time!</p></div>
<p>Take a moment to make sure you’ve done everything right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get some high-quality lube</strong> – Water based lube is the best as it can be used with condoms also. You can still make a woman orgasm without lube, but it’s not recommended.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buy spare sheets</strong> – If she’s a “gusher” then you’re going to be going through a lot of sheets dude.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spruce up your place</strong> – Make sure your apartment is presentable, clean and comfortable. If she’s not comfortable, then you’ll have a hard time making her squirt.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take your time</strong> – It’s not a race, most girls will take around 20 to 30 minutes before you can make them squirt. However if you see the girl more than once and she’s very comfortable sexually around you, it will be seconds to a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that’s <em>how to make women squirt</em> on demand… even though they are the basics they still work wonders.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Squirting orgasms are seriously easy when you get the first one down, because you’re way more confident the next time.</p>
<p><em>Now you know how to make a girl squirt, are you going to use the techniques on your girl?</em></p>

			<p>I’m wondering if in your opinion my issue is psychological or physical. I’m so unsure of what has happened but I do know I am going to be very unhappy and depressed if this continues. So up until a little over a year ago I was pretty much always able to easily have a clitoral orgasm through self play and most of the time able to soak the sheets immediately after. Sometimes unable to stop the squirting. Me and my husband had some serious issues come up and I discovered he had an out of control addiction to porn and hook up sites that had been the reason he was leaving me in constant state of frustration and feeling unwanted for three yrs having virtually no intimacy the entire time. When I discovered his secret we almost seperated but have stayed together and says he stopped the porn but soon after I found out, within a few months I became unable to have wet orgasms and difficulty even achieving a clitoral orgasm sometimes. I’m 44 and was 42 or 43 at the time the change occurred. Do you think my age may be the issue or something that changed after I had a nervous breakdown because of his porn addiction and lack of interest in me. Just to clarify I am an attractive very sexual woman who does not look my age. Please help me figure this out.</p>

			<p>I learned this technique back in my mid 20s simply by good luck and messing around with my girlfriend.  She had a lot more sexual stamina than I did so I had to find something to keep her happy.  I was using my fingers like this and I could feel a swelling inside her vagina and contractions.  However she didn’t squirt just got soaking wet.  I realise now that she was probably worried about peeing and so stopped me.  A pity but really useful article as now I know.</p>

			<p>Question:  How is it that some Asian porn stars can squirt so much so  often?<br>
Seems like a few squirt like a fire hose attached to a hydrant for up to a minute and then do it again just a few minutes later.  I think they would be dehydrated after one squirt, much more so after 2, 3 or even 4 similar squirts.  Just wondering if anyone else knows how that happens.  Would love to find someone who does that.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just starter to  explor this squirting thing. One time I thougt I pee my self, so I quicley retrieved my self and thout: What the h… Was that? And that was just under a regular missionary position.<br>
Now we have tried to make me squirte. But I only get this intense orgasm feeling and it just going on and on as long as I want. don’t seems to stop. But no squirting. It only gets very wet. And the intens feeling is so intens that I have been thinking that I might be becurs I have trouble to relax properly.  Almost overwhelming to handle.<br>
What is wrong?</p>

			<p>Its not what’s wrong. Think about what’s right. Think positive response to yourself ….as long as your comfortable. If you think about squirting and are rushing the felling it most likely will not happen, do to you not being completely comfortable make sure your %100 comfortable while you doing your business. Close your eyes and think of what’s right</p>

			<p>Hey brother. First get in the gym juice up if need be get that killer bod goin. When your confident about yourself youll perform better. Spice things up go to a sex shop together. Honestly some women just cant cum from inter course. Ive been with over 1k women easily. Ive had gf like this too. So get your oral sex game on point. Little things help. Great foreplay, water based lubes are great, and suprise her, be demanding youre the fng man remember that. Get her in the car and go to a sex shop together. If i have a new partner i always ask where her fav spots are….try oral take your fingers spread her lips a bit so that g spot is just all alone in right field and ask her some girls like the tip of the tongue slow some fast, some like the middle of the tongue. Communicate how and where her fav spot on g is. Some ive noticed tell my the bottom some dead center some (most like it all) dont be shy dig your face right in there bro and be the alpha male in the relationship. Those few tips after 16 years should help. Physical appearance isnt everything but its a big part, same with communicating on her wants, needs, good spots. Hope it helped.</p>

			<p>My friend NO blame here…it’s not your fault or hers…orgasm is is natural body function but without the right formula for orgasm it can be a problem for women, where for men it’s not so difficult. Now remember for a woman her sexuality is wholistic in its nature so only stimulating her vagina is not always the best. Try finding something you do together that makes her laugh and take your time showing her she is all you need or want…but dontt be a ” pussy” pun intended… Be strong  but attentive and respectful she will relax and feel safe and then my friend did you still can’t get her turned on…don’t be afraid to get out the box…she might be more of a freak than you think!!</p>

			<p>I am very fortunate this comes natural to me. However as I was growing up,I thought I had some kind of problem. As I got older I wanted to ask my gyno but was to embarrassed. My first husband and I enjoyed sex but we’d figure it was just a good orgasims. When I divorced it was hard for me cause I figured I had a big problem. So this stopped me from taking relationships further. When I met my second husband and after a couple of months the time came we both wanted  intimacy I broke down and crying told him what would happend if we had SEX ( me wetting all the bed) he was in shock n me more cause I really thought I had a problem weeding his face. Ai had never tried googling what happend to me and he immediately googled and asked me after seeing a video ” is this what you do ?” And I said yes. He was happy and I was puzzled. A that moment I finally read what my body was able to do so normal. And at that moment I realized I didn’t have a problem but a gift. I have learned to enjoy what I have been gifted with. I feel every woman should experience this. I’m amazed how men love this.</p>

			<p>Bro if your girl gets up to pee, there is a way to overcome this little problem. Guys are you paying attention cos the women who striuggle to squirt in many cases tense the fk up cos they think they are going to pee themselves. If you do exactly as outlined above and in addition to that have them stanging up, legs spread, one lfoot on ground, one foot on chair or elevated…when women stand up they hav no power of holding back the fluid…lying down they can hold back but standing position the fluid will just pour out…do this once twice and they will, become accustomed to the feeling/sensation and not tense up so will be easier to squirt lying down too</p>

			<p>Take the pressure off her. If you want her to come and she knows it, she may not relax enough. Just have fun enjoy, and help her out if she is willing. She may or may not be able/comfortable doing it on her own, or with her own hands. She also may not like to be expected to do it, if those thoughts are in her head, she will not let go enough to squirt. And it won’t happen every time, doesn’t mean sex isn’t great.</p>

			<p>Im 36 and spent 18 years with my ex. I taught her to squirt across the room our entire relationship. For the past five years i have gotten with a new woman who is a decade less my age. From the start i told her that one of these days i would make her squirt.i told her she had to let go of the ticklish point and relax. We were apart for several months then got back together. After two weeks of all night sex, she got off but would close her legs on mestill soi taped her hands to her ankles and teased her clit with my head (cock head). Right before she came i stoppd drilling. She wasnt happy and whined bout me stopping so i taught her what no other gets to mine</p>

			<p>I’ve tried this methods many times on my girlfriend even before I read this article. I basically learned this by myself thru trial and error. And Yes it works for us. She squirts each time I do it. Some days I play with the clit with my left hand and do this method with my right hand. She loves it. But she loves the dick more. Also a little info on me. I’ve only had sex with one person.  She was the first person I lost my virginity to, so meaning I had never had sex until I was 21. She was only 19 and had been with 1 guy only. Her ex had a 3 inch and she said it felt okay but never experienced an organism because her ex only had sex for his own pleasure. On the other hand, I had a 4.5in girth, 5.5 -6 inch penis (it fluctuates from now and then depending on how she wakes up my penis,) me being a virgin I had no clue on what to do and went base off porn videos. I was also shy of my size. Laugh out loud.  So I stuck it in and she was amaze about the difference in size and had an vaginal orgasm after I stroke it my penis inside her vagina really fast for a minute or two. Not knowing what a g-spot was, I got lucky the first time and the first night and she squirted all over the back seats. It was also my first time feeling the warmth and juicy-ness of a vagina. And the first and last time I did it in my car. I came at the time she did too, and she told me she didn’t know she was a squirter, or experienced an orgasm and experienced this kind of sex before. Another info on us. I’m 5’9 Asian male, she is 5’11 Asian female. Pretty tall – thick for an Asian female. Omg lucky me right? Now when we have sex I don’t even finger her for to squirt, because she prefers the dick to make her squirt because it feels way more amazing than the fingers. But I use the fingers as my back up when my tongue is tired, and my penis won’t wake up after a good 5-10 minute of sucking. I know I went off topic there, but don’t let my story discourage you guys. This finger method works. It’s also a great experience to see her squirt if you never seen it in person. </p>
<p>My experience<br>
—-What I also do sometimes is eat her pussy until she goes into a clitoris orgasm then I quickly change my position into this method of fingering. I finger her really fast and she tends to get a vaginal orgasm and squirts. My girlfriend tells me it freaking amazing when I do this to her.  She tells me I get to feel both types of orgasm at the same time and it makes her feel like she’s in heaven. Lol. From my point of views, she shakes a lot and her eyes rolls up and she looks like is experiencing some kind of super high sensation. Then when she comes back from her most pleasurable moment she tells me she loves me and wants more. Lucky me right?</p>

			<p>Im ashamed to say i have never have any type of orgasm as a matter of fact i dont know how it feels……. I am the type of girl who is really opened minded and woild try/do anything that deals with sex but, saddly i cant orgasm for nothing the only thing that happens is i get even hornier then before and become sexually fustrated and sad. I now have a boyfriend of 4 1/2 months and i told him this and he is trying at one point and time i felt as if i was close but in the end it never cam and so i lie to him and say he is the best cause i luv him. Can some one tell me what im doing wrong and how to fix it so i can finally shake and scream like most women say that this amazing thing does to them :(</p>

			<p>First of all, if you have nothing in your past that prevents you from feeling free(ie insecurities about self image or bad sexual experiences/molestation) and you feel at ease with your partner then…<br>
1) Be vocal about what feels really good to you with partner (moans and words work equally as well if your partner is smart). Sometimes, it could be that your partner(s) simply doesn’t know how to pleasure you. Perhaps try oral, toys, and different positions…generally, I’ve discovered females prefer good kissing/foreplay/candles/satin or silk/oral stimulation to tease to the limit/then missionary followed by female on top… This seems to be the easiest way for a woman to achieve clitoral orgasm. Vaginal is more difficult but positions and angles are very important.<br>
2) Have the mood just perfect…scented candles and music and temperatures… Get your partner to take a shower with you to warm things up followed by warm towels and a nice massage.<br>
3) Masturbate-so you understand what positions and what helps you to your O.  If you can’t do this, then try imagining different fantasies, etc. </p>
<p>Simply put, do not try to achieve an orgasm but ENJOY and LEARN to be sensual with your partner.  Enjoy one another’s skin, smell, lips, bodies, and moan when partner does the right things… Do not be so quick to get to be sexual but try and use your senses…perhaps blindfold yourselves and play with one another….</p>
<p>Orgasms will come aplenty once you give yourself up to one another!  Good luck and enjoy the journey!</p>

			<p>You need to devote time and patience to it – and be honest.<br>
Yes, you have to go to him and admit that it was not real. Otherwise, you’ve killed it with this guy – he’ll never be able to share the experience of your first o with you and him, because he won’t even know what’s going on.</p>
<p>Look at it this way, it’s a matter of patience. You feel underconfident because you felt disappointed with the past, but if you are patient then you can be confident about cumming — sooner or later.</p>
<p>Best not aim for squirting and probably don’t aim to do it with your boyfriend. For most women, clitoral orgasm is easier and you need to allow yourself to get more and more turned on without letting yourself fear that you won’t come. Hypnotherapy can help in that respect – if you get rid of your fears and be patient with yourself, you will come just fine. It may take 2 or 3 hours. Meditate on whatever you find most arousing and keep jilling gently and continuously. Being able to do it for yourself is the first step, then teach your man and start learning together.</p>

			<p>My wife squirted the last time we made love. We both joked about it (I was pleased and thought it was great) but she was a bit embarrassed about it. We have not been together since this that night but I will be flying home in a few days and I will show her this so we can both enjoy more of this. By the way she only squirted on the odd occasion and I never knew what caused this. Now I know the techniques I will be putting this to practise. Thanks for all your words.</p>

Her orgasms sometimes last for minute, to the point that she has to push me away because the pleasure is sometimes to intense..the shakes and everything :) doing it with your penis makes it even better for the man also, you can feel when shes about to gush</p>

The key is getting to her to relax, maybe tell her the things you just said and try to help her out as much as possible with whatever kids housework running around.

			<p>Women like a dominant man in the bedroom. They don’t wanna be a slave(most anyways), but they like the man to take control. It goes back to the wild aspect of humans. Women chose their mate based on their ability to protect them, dominance is what they responded to. Don’t constantley ask if that’s what she likes, she will loose her train of thought and get frustrated, change positions without asking, but not too frequently. Pull her hair a little. And sorry, I’m not a female, but trust me. Go a little alpha and she will respond and let u try.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been dating this girl for over a year now. Usually, before we have sex, I play with her for a good 10 min, but I have been unable to make her squirt. I have tried using the techniques described above but no success. Each time, she tells me that there is an urge to “go to the bathroom” before she finishes. I thought it was her love juices about to explode so I’ve told her to just let it go. However, she is still unable…. I usually start off slow in missionary position with a finger and work up to two fingers in a cupping motion and a “come to” motion against her g-spot. I usually am going very hard by the time she finishes… but never any squirting. Any advice on this? Should I use lube? What else can I do? I really want to make her squirt!</p>

			<p>Take your free hand and push down just  above  her pubic bone. The pressure is amazing and gets me going. You can even sit beside her and wrap your free arm around her back  holding her  close a nd have her apply pressure. My boyfriend and I accomplished this glorious event last week &amp; last night he got me to do it three times within  2 hours. I even got distance on them this time. I was able to watch the second tonad it is amazing to see.</p>

			<p>oh god! now I know about this!! Every-time my and wife have a  hot sex session for a long time, while I keep grinding her with my tool, after a long time she stops me saying that she has to pee! Still while try to continue pumping her  with my tool , she shows great desperation asking me to stop. Not knowing the situation and not wanting to hurt her, I always stop and let her go to pee and come back to continue!<br>
Now on-wards, I will never let her get up and go to pee but  enjoy a beautiful bath for my tool from her juice and make her feel the pleasure. Desperate to experience this while watching her cute face!! Byt he way my tool is 6 inches long and 5 inch thick. Is that I am able to do with my tool what is been told above to be done with fingers ? Can that happen ?</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone here for educating me with this beautiful process for my wife !! i am ever grateful to you all !</p>

			<p>Invest in a waterproof mattress cover. Fear of ruining a mattress has held me back many times! Sheet changing….no problem. But relaxation and trust with a talented lover has the potential to result in a thorough bed soaking. Knowing that the mattress won’t be ruined can help to her to feel comfortable enough to let it all go!</p>

			<p>I had a partner who could make me literally flood the bed EVERY time, even when I tried not too.  He did similar to what is explained here but with a few added tricks that I found VERY good.</p>
<p>#1Let it build.  When you can feel she’s almost at the height of it and getting ready to orgasm, back off. Focus on something else for a little bit then go back to it.  This will increase the intensity and likelyhood of a full on flood.</p>
<p>#2 Practice holding back.  It is also possible for a woman to control the flood gates.  Focus the sensation into other parts of the body.  Consciously contracting in other parts of the body and avoiding “baring down” into the orgasm.</p>
<p>#3  Once you know you’ve brought her to climax continue stimulating for about 2 seconds to be sure she full on into orgasm and then stimulate the uretra opening (the hole the pee comes out) either by gentle stroking, gently pushing, fast rubbing, whatever the day calls for.  We’ve used all three techniques on different days.  I find this the most effective and often makes the difference between a regular orgasm and a flood.</p>
<p>Using these techniques he could make me “squirt” over and over.  I once made the mistake of telling him I thought I was “dehydrated” and couldn’t possibly “cum” any more.  He took that as a challenge and we used all 8 bath sized towels.</p>

			<p>hey everyone,<br>
 i am a 25 year old female and i have just recently experienced this. i have been with other men and women and i never have had a feeling like this. i am really new to this and yea i still say that it feels like pee. but ladies let it go. my husband told me he could make me squirt and i never believed it. i honeslty thought at first that it was nasty but boy was i wrong!!! i will continue to get better at this to be able to enjoy it myself and to be able to watch him look at me the way he does (amazingly) whenever he makes me squrit. maybe the first time was pee.. who knows .. but now i can say its not… it has always been hard for me to get off by penetration (and i have 2 kids) and i never really liked it but now i want more…and more..lol so just lay back and enjoy your self and let it go… if you think its nasty then take a shower afterwards.. you wont regret it.. promise….</p>

			<p>U should tell him not to be an ass, sex aint just about the men. If that was the case humanity would be doomed coz women would be lesbians so that they can get the sex they want from a partner and men…well we would just have to fondle our own junk. If I wasnt married I would help u out but wife would be pissed (kidding) lol. If u want to squirt my advice is find techniques or change these techniques to make it so u can do it solo and when he asks for sex say sorry while u werent interested I made myself squirt so im good til tomorrow, the next day make urself squirt again and when he asks say same thing but this time add if u help me squirt we would be having sex hopefully when he does it he will wanna do it again and be asking u for permission to make u squirt….good luck</p>

			<p>I want to this but my girl always has to pee during including when that spot is hit. Is it just she is going to and feels she has to or what. She pees like three to four time during sex. She said she would but when I try stuff like that she makes me stop so she can “pee”. Now I’ve tried just telling her to let it go so we can see if that’s what it is but she always says no I don’t want to pee on you. I understand about her not wanting to pee on me but how can we be sure that’s what it is if she stops all the time. </p>

			<p>I used to do the same thing to my ex. My new boyfriend made me feel really comfortable with it though and you’re right, that’s what it turned out to be. It feels so good, don’t let her miss out on it cuz she’s self conscious! It is possible to actually pee while you do it but as long as she’s gone to the bathroom before hand she won’t. Tell her you’re okay with a little bit of pee if that’s what it takes to get her off. Sometimes it can also be that the sensation that accompanies it is uncomfortable if you don’t know how to relax. It’s like being tickled: it feels really good but it’s too much. There are some good books out there on how to get used to the feeling so you can concentrate on the pleasure and not the discomfort.</p>

			<p>Came across a gusher years back and was intrigued, and have developed the techniques, much the same as you describe and they work on nearly all my conquests. All women have the capability, it’s their ability to relax and yours to help them. Follow the techniques shown it will save you all the experimenting that I had to do. Make sure you locate the G spot it can vary in position with each woman, even to the extent that it is not behind the clitoris but on the back of the vagina.</p>

			<p>Try thrusting the majority of your penis slowly for about 1-2 minutes let it build then start thrusting only your tip in and out at a medium pace, do that for awhile she will definitely have a pleasureable reaction On her face even to the point of shock. And soon enough you will feel her body and her walls start to vibrate, her facial reaction will change to one of pain and pleasure (trust me its allllll pleasureee!) And then prepare youreself for the gushing orgasm. Its amazing feeling her cum so hard</p>

			<p>Wow thank you for this! The first time I gushed I was shocked and thought it was abnormal, I was 27 and had been in and out of relationships all my life.The sex with previous partners were amazing but I just never gushed. It happened when I was with my first night with a new partner. I remember gushing everywhere and was really embarrassed and he didn’t really say much about it. Then nearly every time after that night it would happen without fail, sometimes within seconds. We never really talked about the subject, we would just make jokes and laugh about needing new sheets, so he didn’t know I have only ever gushed with him, I didn’t know I was the first woman he had made gush and I didn’t know how much he actually loved it, so for a long time I wouldn’t let him go down on me or do 69 and held back a bit sexually just in case he would be put off. I have attempted to do it myself and only have once. I cant control when I do it, I can have an orgasm without gushing and some with, but the gushing is never as extreme like it is in most porn. But what you say about feeling comfortable is very true, If we would argue before and have’ make up sex’ 9 times out of 10 I would not gush at all as I would secretly still be in a mood or just not feel comfortable. But when we would get on new sheets would be needed by the end of the night. So the only advice I would give as a female gusher is to make her feel comfortable and tell her you love it if you do, as she might not know what on earth has just happened and you could miss out on some great sex together. I have read starting off with slow strokes and the woman being naturally wet first will make the orgasm more intense, produce more fluid and make her intensely shake and shiver after. Of course I shall be testing this :)</p>

			<p>There is nothing better for a guy than when a woman reaches orgasm – and nothing worse than when he is unable to even make her nice n wet. It’s a real feeling of failure! My wife &amp; I have a great sex life and I can’t wait to try this new method. I’ve never researched until today. When she does orgasm, she will typically be vocal and tell me to go down on her or jump up &amp; straddle me. The mess is a great thing for us to both smile about!</p>

			<p>Have been doing this for years! At first wondered why the sheets looked she had peed on them. Realized what it was! She was breathless and shaking and it was amazing to watch her! BUT try this way and it should make it a much smoother time for her. Put your same two fingers inside and stroke with the same motion and with your thumb start stroking the Clitoris! Smooth motions pressing a little more with the fingers and within five to 8 minutes she will have a puddle on the sheets along with wrapping her legs around you and wanting you in her!<br>

			<p>Hey there, its quite obvious to tell if your squirting or peeing. my girlfriend is a big time squirter and she thought the same thing the first times she squirted. If you’re a female you should know when you pee, it doesnt come out of your actualy vagina. It comes out of the urethra above the opening to your vagina. When you squirt your ejaculating strictly from your vagina. Also, the feeling that goes along with it before you actually gush is a dead give away. For a girl whos never had that pleasure, you’ll realize it instantly.</p>

			<p>The only way you’re going to know if you’re squirting or peeing is going to be the pulsating of the orgasm that comes with ejaculation. Robby obviously doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The first woman that I was ever with that squirted was in college and she had never done it before. We had some very intense sex and she soaked my dorm room bed and was so embarrassed that she thought she had peed. I wasn’t sure either what had happened. So we continued to have sex, and i mean all the time, and it became clear that she was having ejaculating orgasms. The second time we did it she stopped me and said that she thought she had to pee. I told her that it didn’t matter if she peed or not and when she started to have an orgasm she just started gushing a clear almost sticky liquid. She realized what was happening that time and noticed that the feeling is a little different. Unfortunately we are not in contact anymore so I can’t get her perspective on it for you. I do know however that we got really messed up one time and were messing around and during intercourse she literally sat up and pissed all over me haha. She said “ummm, that was pee.” Actually happened twice that night haha! But at least i knew that she could tell the difference. I hope this helps you a little!</p>

			<p>Ok so i dated a guy about a year ago that made me squirt, then he cheated and we stopped seeing each other… I have tried over and over to squirt again since then…. I read this while at a friend’s house, which im still at lol, and went to the bathroom to give this a try…i peed first then wiped… Then starting using this technique, but only used one finger and within maybe two to three minutes my g spot ballooned so i was firmer and then gushed the first time… I decided to try again… Within another few strokes gushed again… Did it one last time and in no time in happened one last time…  i made myself stop so i didnt pass out in their bathroom… And this will sound nuts, but i only told all of that because i still am not sure i wasnt just peeing again each time… How would i know for sure? Im feel totally embarrassed for asking this but i cant help but question it… It felt good but felt better the first time when the guy was doing it to me… But i guess that only makes sense lol… Sorry so long… I must still be a bit excited :-P</p>

			<p>I am able to squirt with vaginal and anal penetration &amp; quite recently am able to squirt with clitirol stimulation as well. I can’t squirt with any guy, I have got to feel an emotional connection, I have got to feel that he appreciates me for me &amp; touches me from the inside out. Unfortunately relationships don’t come easy in this day and age, guys want to keep their options open (it’s all about timing). I am learning to “play the game”.</p>
<p>Only one guy has managed to make me squirt with his fingers and penis – with my help. So my advise to all u ladies out there is get to know ur own body – do alot of DIY, with ur fingers so u know exactly where that spot is. Don’t try it missionary as the vagina can become hollow when very wet. Prepare by going for a pee before u start ur session cos the sensation is exactly the same as when ur desperate to pee. Get loads of towels under u, sit on the floor with ur hips slightly tilted as if ur on top of ur man riding him. Go for the palm stimulating the clit technique – works every time. U will feel every muscle in ur body relaxing. Ur vagina will push &amp; suck ur finger/s when the G spot swells up. Sometimes a bit of pee comes out just before ur juices start gushing out. If ur doing ur DIY days after u’ve finished ur period the colour can be a little darker. I think every woman is able to squirt cos when I ask my girls – do feel like u need to pee when ur man is pumping u they’ve all said yes – I tell them let go.</p>
<p> I can make myself squirt within minutes but will not give a guy the satisfaction of making me squirt if he’s just a”bootie call”. Once u’ve mastered it u will discover many ways to make urself squirt ladies. Just give urself enough play time &amp; don’t put too much pressure on urself.</p>
<p>Guys if ur finger is not clean enough to put in ur mouth it’s not clean enough to go inside her ;-)</p>
<p>Good luck all &amp; play it safe!</p>

			<p>I am really excited to try this!  My man loves squirting porn, but I’ve never squirted.  When we first started dating he told me about one of the girls he dated and how “something about her just turned him on”…. She was a squirter!  He’s amazing in bed, multiple o’s every time!  But I want him to have that same desire for me…. Hope this works!  :-)</p>

			<p>good to see this has become something great im 26 and i have succeeded this technique at the age of 20 with every gf i had, i started of with the fingering but then i use my tongue straight after leaving no pause time in a fast pace motion left to right on her clit where her urine will come out make her scream and say omg and walla bobs your uncle cover your face i dont i want her to come on me i love oral its the best part esp tasting her mmmmm. the technique you mentioned is absolutely correct  works like a charm for the beginners once you are familiar with it you can try other things. you can also do it while penetrating her starting slow then gaining momentum then when she starts to scream pull with a force that grazes her clit and she will missile, try the 69 also, if you get tired which most guys do then use a vibrator which you can get at any adult store ( also for the guys with premature ejaculation) you need to make her cum while also inside her. an average man last up to 5min penetration. happy squirting everyone.</p>

			<p>I thought this was a myth, but after seeing quite a few videos online I am convinced this is something I should work on. I am a girl and I am married with a man who makes me come really well.

			<p>Great info here, but you’ve got a few things very wrong. Women can have 9 types of orgasms and men can have two. Also, the clitoris has many, many more nerve endings than the penis.</p>
<p>At any rate, thanks for helping to get the word out. Once I figured out how to do it, I can squirt on command, but not all women can.</p>

			<p>There’s a minor (like teenee tiny) percentage of women who can’t squirt. But most women can, so you it’s probably down to you not being relaxed enough and finding a guy who is capable of doing it. Some women take longer than others, start with a massage, move onto an erotic massage and fully relax for a good 30 minutes before you give it a try. You need to be turned on by the guy also.</p>

			<p>This page iOS the best page on the Internet.</p>
<p>I used to think females squirting was a porn trick that wasn’t real for normal people, until I found this site.</p>
<p>First time I tried it I never said a word to my wife, she didn’t squirt but her orgasm was fast and explosive, the next day she actually asked me what I did so different as she loved it although she did confess that she felt like she was going to pee herself so she held it in.  A few days later I gave it another go having recently told my wife what I was up to and assuring her that it was not pee, she didn’t squirt as such however she did leave a nice wet spot on the bed.  The next weekend we gave it another go and bingo, she was squirting all over me, the bed and anything else that was in the way, but he end of the night she had squirted hard four times and it was tough to find a dry patch, she definitely loved the experience and this will be a regular experience from here on in.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the guide, great stuff.</p>

			<p>I found a trick to speed things up, once you feel the ballooning on her G spot turn you hand around so that your palm faces down, keep the two fingers in and pump hard, she should be squirting within seconds.</p>

			<p>I am a Widower Guy of 59 and have a relationship with a lady of 53 (four grown up boys all by Caesarion Section) for the past 18 months – so down stairs is pure. We have made love at a rate of at least every second day during this time – including a run of 21 days in row  I have nurtured her along to be a natural woman agian and where she should have been all these years  First trained her to squirt with the two finger hand method  (which she no longer desires)  And now she continually has vaginal clit and squirting orgasms to exhaustion with just my penis  A lot of the time with my control in holding back blowing (and saving it for next time ) she just cums and cums and cums …it is so good I dont even blow but just enjoy getting my woman up and passed total bliss every time</p>

			<p>I personally learned how 2 squirt like 7 years ago when I was a teen and now if I orgasm W/o soaking everything it hurts me. I’m guessing it is the female equivalent of blue balls and it is aweful. But I can only squirt by myself, recently got a vch (vertical clit hood) pricing and now I dont even need penetration 2 sqirt just my magic wand. And it only takes 5 min or so compared 2 atleast an hr W/o it and my rabbit that broke. Oh man I love my body and my vch!  maybe I could squirt w/ a man now Idk haven’t been w/ a man since I got my new addition 2 my body.</p>

			<p>Well i can confirm that it works too… On two different women in last six months..<br>
First one was a bit preturbed that  i had managed to make her soak her sheets<br>
and she couldn’t handle  the  mess and me being  like a kid in a candy store…<br>
Second woman well… only slept with her twice now but i have had  her  squirting<br>
so hard it hit me on the chest and on the second time in th eye!!<br>
If worked even better when she was on her back and i alternated from  rubbing the gspot<br>
to turning my fingers downwards  and pushing against the vaginal wall and she<br>
squirted so hard it hit me in the eye!!!</p>
<p>She also produced a little bit of milk from her nipples it had that much of an effect!!<br>
Both ‘milk’ and squirt juice were nice to the taste and she left one very happy lady<br>
and me feeling like a sex god!<br>
When i watched her near the end you could see the eurethra  rise up and  ‘dome out’<br>
before it shot the fluid out of her and her feeling fantastic…<br>
Prepare to get wet guys but boy is it fun and the looks you get from them is priceless  in<br>
how much they want you!</p>

			<p>Ok Yes it works<br>
I have been using this method on my woman for 35 years and never an unhappy customer Infact most come back for more So Why Marry???<br>
I agree make sure you have a tidy clean well presented love nest and clean fresh sheets are always a nice touch. Make sure your girl is relaxed and not to drunk Take your time with foreplay as woman love that.<br>
Start kissing them on the lips neck and spend some time gently massaging their body, pay some attention to their Tits and some soft taps or scatching of their buttocks helps as their buttocks are full of nurve endings that are wired strait to the horn bag section of their brain.<br>
Good luck all men out there hope this helps and for the woman out there ENJOY like mine have.</p>

			<p>Great technique! Works like a charm. To gain a similar experience during intercourse try this! Have the man lay on his back with one leg bent at the knee and his foot flat on the bed. The woman then sits on “him” reverse cowgirl but with her legs spread and kneeling on either side of his bent knee. She should be angled slightly away from his body. This position allows her to rub her clitoral area on his thigh as he is inside her. This way, she controls the simultaneous motion. Beware! Your leg will get chafed if she isn’t smooth! Enjoy!</p>

			<p>Hey Gambler, I LOVE what you’ve got going on here… And I deeply enjoyed reading this post, although it’s meant for the eyes of men. ;)</p>
<p>I’m one of those women who thought that she couldn’t have a squirting orgasm, but once my man learned the right techniques (pretty similar to what you describe, with a few other refinements) it literally felt like litres of fluid were coming out of me (laundry time!)…<br>
It also felt like an upside down waterfall of orgasmic energy was rushing up through my body + a deep release down through my legs, leaving them feeling sort of liquid. Tears of aroused joy – and my boyfriend looked like the happiest man in the world! ;)</p>
<p>THANK YOU so much for teaching guys this! (This technique works EVERY SINGLE TIME.)<br>
Looking fwd to reading more… ;)</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Ronja</p>
<p>P.S. You men can also experience full body orgasms (without ejaculating) once you master some Tantric tricks and learn how to circulate the sexual energy up your spine, into your brain and throughout your entire body. I’ve seen it, I’ve felt it, I know many men who experience it.</p>
<p>And I’ve personally experienced full-body valley orgasms that keep on coming for 30 minutes (usually) and (a few lucky times in my life) for HOURS (5 hours is my max so far).</p>
<p>Bottom line: most people don’t ever experience this, but we are so much more orgasmic than we think.</p>

			<p>Hey Ronja,</p>
<p>What other refinements would you recommend?  I’ve been wanting to do this for a while now and my girl also really wants to. Any recommendations for her or myself?  I’ve heard that most girl contract when they cum, but to squirt you need to release and/or push in the opposite direction.  Any thoughts?</p>
